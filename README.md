# Operanter: Operant conditioning with Raspberry Pi

Operanter controls operant conditioning on the Raspberry Pi. It offers an inexpensive and flexible alternative to proprietary and commercial setups. 

It runs on the Raspberry Pi B+ with Raspbian Jessie and can control any operant conditioning scheme (e.g. Go/NoGo, 2-Alternative Forced Choice, and ABX) using peripheral devices that cost ~Â£250 to build.
